    "\n",
    "All Cytokit experiment configurations are represented as yaml documents and a typical use case involving these documents would be to define one \"template\" or \"base\" configuration for a project that contains all information likely to be shared across replicates or varying parameterizations in processing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While it would be possible to manually create separate configuration files for each of these, the primary purpose of Cytokit is to make batch processing like this more manageable across many replicates and processing configurations.  To this end, the ```cytokit config editor``` command can be used to make small changes to a template configuration and an example of this is shown below.\n",

    "See [experiment_pha.yaml](https://github.com/hammerlab/cytokit/blob/ba73d8b7d9dd4b3286df8bd8afe22826bd7e44f9/pub/config/cellular-marker/experiment_pha.yaml) for more details on the base configuration being modified here.  Note below that nearly all the changes made to the configuration are related to defining a subset of the original experiment and in particular, ```index_symlinks``` provides a way to remap any of the indexes mentioned as required in image paths in the section above to a new range.  This is used below to select 7 of 25 z-planes (from index 14 to index 20) but could also be used to define tile or channel subsets as well:"
